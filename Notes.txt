I have written a script.


It goes to IMDB and enters the name of a productions. Then it clicks the first result that tha contains the name of the production. Then when the page has refreshed it click the full cast and crew. 


Now I want to create a production Manager DB. I want to store: 

PM's Name: xxx Production Title: xxxx Company name: xxxx 

This means that I will be able to write to them in the way I wrote to the PD's and tell them that I've worked for the same companies as them.
