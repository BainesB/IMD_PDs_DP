It would be good to speed it up a bit. 

Now i need to think about how i want to save the data in a sqlite file 

Then i want to break up the title list so that I can  do it in chuncks when i'm out and about. 

## had an idea. watched Gardeners World. Heard that Monty Dons sister broke her neck in car crash. 

## I could scrape imdb to get a list of celebrities. 

## Then automate going to the the celebrities wiki page. 

## The create list celebirties where 'car crash' appears on their page. 

This could give me a lsit of ppl to contact about road violence.
